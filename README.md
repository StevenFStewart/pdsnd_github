### Bikeshare Project by Steven Stewart

### Description
Created for the Udacity Programming for Data Science in Python course.

The project allows the user to calculate selected statistical analysis
on bike share data from three U.S. cities, **Chicago, New York** and
**Washington**.

### Files used
The following files are included in this project:
- bikeshare.py
- README.md

### Credits
Thanks to [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) for offering a wonderful course.

In addition, I'd like to specifically credit this [convert a timedelta to days hours and minutes StackFlow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2119472/convert-a-timedelta-to-days-hours-and-minutes) which I referenced when writing the code for the project.
